# Getting Started

This program uses the following packages:
React
puppeteer-extra
puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth
Ollama
express
cors
node

Make sure these packages are installed to run the code

## Running the code

Open 3 terminals

The first one run "ollama serve" - this activates the AI

The second one - run node on index.js in /backend

The third one - run "npm start"

## Note to Developers

I was forced to use a free AI so that AI may be poorer than most would like. To fix, change the AI in paragon.js

The free AI may also give poor results if ran extensively so just refresh the page.

There are 2 web scrapers, one in readerFile.js and one in paragon.js

## Personal Note

Is this program perfect? No, far from it.

However, the structure of the program leaves it relatively easy to swap different pieces.
